description: YMD_gh aims to create a space together for conversations about experiences
  with mental health in senior high schools in Ghana, to connect with visionaries
  of mental health in Ghana and to build a resource network that can be easily accessed.
  Our vision is to see mental health education implemented in senior high schools
  in order to promote mental health. Having youth who have healthy minds means a better
  brighter future for Ghana, Africa, and the world because we are equipped to succeed
  in life!
